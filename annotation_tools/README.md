# Driver Monitoring Dataset (DMD)
The [Driver Monitoring Dataset](http://dmd.vicomtech.org/) is the largest visual dataset for real driving actions, with footage from synchronized multiple cameras (body, face, hands) and multiple streams (RGB, Depth, IR) recorded in two scenarios (real car, driving simulator). Different annotated labels related to distraction, fatigue and gaze-head pose can be used to train Deep Learning models for Driver Monitor Systems.

This project includes a tool to annotate the dataset, inspect the annotated data and export training sets. Output annotations are formatted using [VCD (Video Content Description)](https://vcd.vicomtech.org/) language.

## Dataset details
More details of the recording and video material of DMD can be found at the [official website](http://dmd.vicomtech.org/)

In addition, this repository [wiki](https://github.com/Vicomtech/DMD-Driver-Monitoring-Dataset/wiki) has useful information about the DMD dataset and the annotation process.

## Available tools:
- Temporal Annotation Tool (TaTo) - (more info [here](annotation-tool/README.md)) 
- Dataset Explorer Tool (DEx) - (more info [here](exploreMaterial-tool/README.md))
### Annotation Instructions
Depending the annotation problem, different annotation criteria should be defined to guarantee all the annotators produce the same output annotations.  

We have defined the following criteria to be used with tool to produce consistent annotations:
